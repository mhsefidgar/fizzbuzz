### In this repo, a RESTful API project is implemented in windows OS.

### The application used is Fastapi as a web framework and Nginx as a web server. Also, Web Server Gateway Interfaces (WSGI) employed is Uvicorn. 

### The reason for selecting this HuggingFace model (T5 Small) is because it is a Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer and has many applications in NLP. 

### The application of this model (T5 Small) is very interesting. The sample T5 Small applications are as follows:

* Text translation.
* Question answering.
* Classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis).

### Another important reason is that this model is lightweight and suitable for real-time tasks. Also, the training can be implemented on TPU, reducing carbon emissions dramatically. 

### Please refer to the following link if you need to calculate the carbon emissions of training your model.

### The technology used is Fastapi as a web framework and Nginx as a web server. Also, Uvicorn is a Web Server Gateway Interfaces (WSGI) employed. 

### The reason for selecting this HuggingFace model (T5 Small) is because it is a Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer and has a number of applications in NLP. 

### The application of this model (T5 Small) is fascinating. The sample T5 Small applications are as follows:

* Text translation.
* Question answering.
* Classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis).

### Another important reason is that this model is lightweight and suitable for real-time tasks. Also, the training can be implemented on TPU, reducing carbon emissions dramatically. 

### Please refer to the following link if you need to calculate the carbon emissions of training your model.

## Reprodusing the results

### This mini project was developed in Windows 11 OS.

### Before running the Nootebook, make sure one of the following tool is running in your computer.

* Windows Docker Desktop  ðŸ‘‰ [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


* Windows Docker Toolbox  ðŸ‘‰ [Windows Docker Toolbox ](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/install-docker-in-windows/)


### *Note That*: It is highly recommened to use windows 11 or Windows 10 build 1909 or later. Evidently the lower build for windows "Windows subsystem for Linux" cannot be turnned on some computers. 


### To reproduce the results, please follow the Notebook instructions.
